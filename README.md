# hello-world

Technology is a stunning aspect to the longevity in our everyday lives.  My first system was an 8-bit Atari 2600.  Universally, I believe the permutations 
classifying data as an asset will face challenging and robust thresholds.  As the digitization of data increases; exponentitally in tandem with computing
power, so too does the need for development of operational security.  Discovery and documentation of failures and successes to efficiently securitize client data
is an utmost importance.  I am interested to continuously increase knowledge depth of security through certification and provide clients with stream-lined solutions.
